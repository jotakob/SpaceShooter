============
Setup
============
The game's executable, located at \export\windows\neko\bin\Flixel_MainProject.exe,
runs on any PC with OpenFL installed, flixel is not required.

In order to compile the game using FlashDevelop follow the following steps:

1. Install flixel using "haxelib install flixel"
2. Replace "C:\HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\flixel\3,3,6\flixel\input\gamepad\FlxGamepadManager.hx" with the one provided in our "/lib" folder (we commented out a small part in the getActiveGamepads function
3. Change the target from flahs to neko
4. Start the game!


============
Controls
============
Gamepad:
Left stick for movement
Right stick for shooting
'A'-button for interaction with buttons etc.

Keyboard:
WSAD for movement
Arrow keys or IJKL for shooting

Additionally, 'N' enables noclip-mode, allowing you to skip the puzzles, which are intended for a group of 4

Notes
============
The warp to the second level is outside the station next to the car.
It only works when less than 4 enemies are left in the level
